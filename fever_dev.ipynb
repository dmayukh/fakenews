The name of the Ukrainian SSR is shown only in Ukrainian , and reads '' \\xd0\\xa3\\xd0\\xba\\xd1\\x80\\xd0\\xb0\\xd1\\x97\\xd0\\xbd\\xd1\\x81\\xd1\\x8c\\xd0\\xba\\xd0\\xb0 PCP '' . The banner bears the Soviet Union state motto -LRB- `` Workers of the world , unite ! '' -RRB- in both the Ukrainian and Russian languages . This flag went out of use on 2 August 1940 , when the Moldavian ASSR was abolished , its territory being divided between the newly created Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic . The flag of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created in 1925 , when the Congress of the Soviets throughout Ukraine approved the Constitution of the Moldavian ASSR , on 10 May . State Flag of the Moldavian ASSR is the flag of Ukrainian SSR , which consists of a red cloth , which has on the upper left corner , near the hoist , a gold hammer and sickle and the letters `` USSR '' in Ukrainian and Moldovan , and below the `` USSR '' initials , with a smaller font , `` Moldavian ASSR '' in Ukrainian and Moldovan . '' Thus , in Section VII , Article 48 , the Constitution stipulated that : `` The Moldavian ASSR has its own state emblem and flag , set by the Moldavian Central Executive Committee and confirmed by the Ukrainian Central Executive Committee '' . On 4 September 1925 , the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Moldavian ASSR discussed the issue `` the contest for drafting the emblem and flag and its jury , consisting of representatives of top party bodies and authorities of the Republic '' .

Ukrainian Republic as Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , 1937 -- 1991 ; Ukrainian Republic as Ukrainian Soviet Republic , Ukrainian People 's Republic of Soviets , 1917 -- 1919 ; Ukrainian Republic as Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic , 1919 -- 1937 ; The modern Ukrainian presidency was formed when the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic passed a law on 5 July 1991 establishing the office of the `` President of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic . '' Upon the proclamation of Ukrainian independence from the Soviet Union on 24 August 1991 , the title was changed to the `` President of Ukraine . '' After the 2014 Ukrainian revolution , Viktor Yanukovych abandoned his office and fled the country . The Uniting for Peace resolution -- also known as the `` Acheson Plan '' -- was adopted 3 November 1950 , after fourteen days of Assembly discussions , by a vote of 52 to 5 -LRB- Czechoslovakia , Poland , the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic -RRB- , with 2 abstentions -LRB- India and Argentina -RRB- . To facilitate prompt action by the General Assembly in the case of a dead-locked Security Council , the resolution created the mechanism of the `` emergency special session '' -LRB- ESS -RRB- , which can be called upon the basis of either a procedural vote in the Security Council , or within twenty-four hours of a request by a majority of UN Members being received by the Secretary-General . While the `` emergency special session '' framework was established by resolution A/RES/377 A , the UN Charter always contained provisions for `` special sessions '' , which , according to the General Assembly 's current `` Rules of Procedure '' , can be called within fifteen days of a request being received by the Secretary-General .
