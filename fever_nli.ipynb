      " b\"[START] led zeppelin was first named the new yardbirds . [END] Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968 . The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page , singer Robert Plant , bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones , and drummer John Bonham . The band 's heavy , guitar-driven sound , rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums , has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal , though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences , including folk music .   After changing their name from the New Yardbirds , Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that afforded them considerable artistic freedom . Although the group was initially unpopular with critics , they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , Led Zeppelin II -LRB- 1969 -RRB- , Led Zeppelin III -LRB- 1970 -RRB- , Led Zeppelin IV -LRB- 1971 -RRB- , Houses of the Holy -LRB- 1973 -RRB- , and Physical Graffiti -LRB- 1975 -RRB- . Their fourth album , which features the track `` Stairway to Heaven '' , is among the most popular and influential works in rock music , and it helped to secure the group 's popularity .   Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin 's music , particularly early in their career , while Plant generally supplied the lyrics . Jones ' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group 's catalogue , which featured increasing experimentation . The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery . Although they remained commercially and critically successful , their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s , and the group disbanded following Bonham 's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980 . In the decades that followed , the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions . The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London , with Jason Bonham taking his late father 's place behind the drums .   Led Zeppelin are widely considered one of the most successful , innovative , and influential rock groups in history . They are one of the best-selling music artists in the history of audio recording ; various sources estimate the group 's record sales at 200 to 300 million units worldwide . With RIAA-certified sales of 111.5 million units , they are the second-best-selling band in the US . Each of their nine studio albums placed in the top 10 of the Billboard album chart and six reached the number-one spot . They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums . Rolling Stone magazine described them as `` the heaviest band of all time '' , `` the biggest band of the Seventies '' , and `` unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history '' . They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 ; the museum 's biography of the band states that they were `` as influential '' during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s . \"\n",

[END] Grunge -LRB- sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound -RRB- is a subgenre of alternative rock and a subculture that emerged during the in the Pacific Northwest U.S. state of Washington , particularly in Seattle and nearby towns . The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle 's independent record label Sub Pop and that region 's underground music scene . By the early 1990s its popularity had spread , with grunge acts appearing in California , then surfacing towards other parts of the United States and in Australia , building strong followings and signing major record deals .   Grunge became commercially successful in the early 1990s , due to releases such as Nirvana 's Nevermind , Pearl Jam 's Ten , Soundgarden 's Superunknown , Alice in Chains ' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots ' Core . The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music at the time . Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s , they influenced modern rock music , as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture and added introspection and an exploration of what it means to be true to oneself . Grunge was also an influence on subsequent genres such as post-grunge and nu metal .   Grunge fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal , such as the distorted electric guitar used in both genres , although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other . Like these genres , grunge typically uses electric guitar , bass guitar , a drummer and a singer . Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth . Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective , often addressing themes such as social alienation , apathy , concerns about confinement , and a desire for freedom .   A number of factors contributed to grunge 's decline in prominence . During the , many grunge bands broke up or became less visible . Nirvana 's Kurt Cobain , labeled by Time as `` the John Lennon of the swinging Northwest '' , appeared unusually tortured by success and struggled with an addiction to heroin before he committed suicide at the age of 27 in 1994 .  Dirt is the second studio album by the American rock band Alice in Chains , released on September 29 , 1992 , through Columbia Records . Peaking at number six on the Billboard 200 , the album was also well received by music critics . It has since been certified four-times platinum by the RIAA and gone on to sell five million copies worldwide , making Dirt the band 's highest selling album to date . It was the last album to feature bassist Mike Starr before he departed the band in early 1993 .   The album spawned five singles : `` Would ? '' , `` Them Bones '' , `` Angry Chair '' , `` Rooster '' , and `` Down in a Hole '' . The songs on the album focused on depression , pain , anger , anti-social behavior , drug addiction -LRB- primarily heroin -RRB- , war , death , and other emotionally charged topics . \"\n",

[END] There is a long history of television and film in New Jersey which is considered the birthplace of the movie picture industry .   The roots of the industry started in Newark with Hannibal Goodwin 's patent of nitrocellulose film in 1887 . Motion picture technology was invented by Thomas Edison , with early work done at his West Orange laboratory . Edison 's Black Maria where the first motion picture to be copyrighted in the United States , Fred Ott 's Sneeze was shot .  America 's first motion picture industry started in 1907 in Fort Lee and the first studio was constructed there in 1909 . Fred Wesley Wentworth was commissioned in 1914 by Jacob Fabian to build the Regent in Paterson , the first facility built exclusively for the exhibition of moving pictures . The nation 's first drive-in theater opened at Airport Circle in 1933 .   DuMont Laboratories in Passaic , developed early sets and made the first broadcast to the private home .   Many television shows and motion picture films have been filmed in New Jersey , which since 1978 maintains a Motion Picture and Television Commission . New Jersey has long held an attraction for producers , both for its locations and the tax credits offered by the state . Governor Christopher Christie suspended the credits in 2010 , but the New Jersey State Legislature in 2011 approved the restoration and expansion of the tax credit program . Under bills passed by both the state Senate and Assembly , the program would offer 20 percent tax credits -LRB- 22 % in urban enterprise zones -RRB- to television and film productions that shoot in the state and meet set standards for hiring and local spending . The tax credit is lower than that of other states offering similar incentives . A controversy arose in 2011 , when the governor threatened to veto the payment of tax rebates to the production company of Jersey Shore , a program he and others felt negatively portrayed New Jersey . As of 2014 , a bill is under consideration in the Senate is that would extend the program and remove any caps on tax credits .

      " b\"[START] the vietnam war has another name . [END] The Vietnam War -LRB- Chi\\xe1\\xba\\xbfn tranh Vi\\xe1\\xbb\\x87t Nam -RRB- , also known as the Second Indochina War , and known in Vietnam as Resistance War Against America -LRB- Kh\\xc3\\xa1ng chi\\xe1\\xba\\xbfn ch\\xe1\\xbb\\x91ng M\\xe1\\xbb\\xb9 -RRB- or simply the American War , was a war that occurred in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975 . It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam . The North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union , China and other communist allies and the South Vietnamese army was supported by the United States , South Korea , Australia , Thailand and other anti-communist allies . The war is therefore considered a Cold War-era proxy war .   The Viet Cong -LRB- also known as the National Liberation Front , or NLF -RRB- , a South Vietnamese communist common front aided by the North , fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region , while the People 's Army of Vietnam , also known as the North Vietnamese Army -LRB- NVA -RRB- , engaged in more conventional warfare , at times committing large units to battle . As the war continued , the military actions of the Viet Cong decreased as the role and engagement of the NVA grew . U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations , involving ground forces , artillery , and airstrikes . In the course of the war , the U.S. conducted a large-scale strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam .   The North Vietnamese government and the Viet Cong were fighting to reunify Vietnam . They viewed the conflict as a colonial war and a continuation of the First Indochina War against forces from France and later on the United States . The U.S. government viewed its involvement in the war as a way to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam . This was part of the domino theory of a wider containment policy , with the stated aim of stopping the spread of communism worldwide .   Beginning in 1950 , American military advisors arrived in what was then French Indochina.The Military Assistance Advisory Group , Indochina -LRB- with an authorized strength of 128 men -RRB- was set up in September 1950 with a mission to oversee the use and distribution of US military equipment by the French and their allies . U.S. involvement escalated in the early 1960s , with troop levels tripling in 1961 and again in 1962 . U.S. involvement escalated further following the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident , in which a U.S. destroyer clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft , which was followed by the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution , which gave the U.S. president authorization to increase U.S. military presence . Regular U.S. combat units were deployed beginning in 1965 . Operations crossed international borders : bordering areas of Laos and Cambodia were heavily bombed by U.S. forces as American involvement in the war peaked in 1968 , the same year that the communist side launched the Tet Offensive . The Tet Offensive failed in its goal of overthrowing the South Vietnamese government , but became the turning point in the war , as it persuaded a large segment of the U.S. population that its government 's claims of progress toward winning the war were illusory despite many years of massive U.S. military aid to South Vietnam .   Gradual withdrawal of U.S. ground forces began as part of `` Vietnamization '' , which aimed to end American involvement in the war while transferring the task of fighting the communists to the South Vietnamese themselves . Despite the Paris Peace Accord , which was signed by all parties in January 1973 , the fighting continued . In the U.S. and the Western world , a large anti-Vietnam War movement developed as part of a larger counterculture . The war changed the dynamics between the Eastern and Western Blocs , and altered North -- South relations .   Direct U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973 . The capture of Saigon by the North Vietnamese Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war , and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year . The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities -LRB- see Vietnam War casualties -RRB- . Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000 to 3.8 million . Some 240,000 -- 300,000 Cambodians , 20,000 -- 62,000 Laotians , and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict , and a further 1,626 remain missing in action . \"\n",

[END] A mandolin -LRB- mandolino -LSB- mando\\xcb\\x88li\\xcb\\x90no -RSB- ; literally `` small mandola '' -RRB- is a musical instrument in the lute family and is usually plucked with a plectrum or `` pick '' . It commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison -LRB- 8 strings -RRB- , although five -LRB- 10 strings -RRB- and six -LRB- 12 strings -RRB- course versions also exist . The courses are normally tuned in a succession of perfect fifths . It is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola , octave mandolin , mandocello and mandobass .   There are many styles of mandolin , but three are common , the Neapolitan or round-backed mandolin , the carved-top mandolin and the flat-backed mandolin . The round-back has a deep bottom , constructed of strips of wood , glued together into a bowl . The carved-top or arch-top mandolin has a much shallower , arched back , and an arched top -- both carved out of wood . The flat-backed mandolin uses thin sheets of wood for the body , braced on the inside for strength in a similar manner to a guitar . Each style of instrument has its own sound quality and is associated with particular forms of music . Neapolitan mandolins feature prominently in European classical music and traditional music . Carved-top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music . Flat-backed instruments are commonly used in Irish , British and Brazilian folk music . Some modern Brazilian instruments feature an extra fifth course tuned a fifth lower than the standard fourth course .   Other mandolin varieties differ primarily in the number of strings and include four-string models -LRB- tuned in fifths -RRB- such as the Brescian and Cremonese , six-string types -LRB- tuned in fourths -RRB- such as the Milanese , Lombard and the Sicilian and 6 course instruments of 12 strings -LRB- two strings per course -RRB- such as the Genoese . There has also been a twelve-string -LRB- three strings per course -RRB- type and an instrument with sixteen-strings -LRB- four strings per course -RRB- .   Much of mandolin development revolved around the soundboard -LRB- the top -RRB- . Pre-mandolin instruments were quiet instruments , strung with as many as six courses of gut strings , and were plucked with the fingers or with a quill . However , modern instruments are louder -- using four courses of metal strings , which exert more pressure than the gut strings . The modern soundboard is designed to withstand the pressure of metal strings that would break earlier instruments . The soundboard comes in many shapes -- but generally round or teardrop-shaped , sometimes with scrolls or other projections . There is usually one or more sound holes in the soundboard , either round , oval , or shaped like a calligraphic -LRB- f-hole -RRB- . A round or oval sound hole may be covered or bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling . \"\n",

According to four federal government investigations and one municipal investigation , These were investigations by : the Federal Bureau of Investigation -LRB- 1963 -RRB- , the Warren Commission -LRB- 1964 -RRB- , the House Select Committee on Assassinations -LRB- 1979 -RRB- , the Secret Service , and the Dallas Police Department . Oswald shot and killed Kennedy as the President traveled by motorcade through Dealey Plaza in the city of Dallas , Texas .   Oswald was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps and defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959 . He lived in the Belarusian city of Minsk until June 1962 , at which time he returned to the United States with Marina , his Russian-born wife , eventually settling in Dallas .   Following Kennedy 's assassination , Oswald was initially arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit , who was killed on a Dallas street about 45 minutes after Kennedy was shot . Oswald was later charged with the murder of Kennedy . He denied shooting anybody , saying that he was a `` patsy '' . Two days later , while being transferred from the city jail to the county jail , Oswald was fatally shot by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby in full view of television cameras broadcasting live .   In September 1964 , the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in assassinating Kennedy by firing three shots from the Texas School Book Depository . This conclusion was supported by previous investigations carried out by the FBI , the Secret Service , and the Dallas Police Department . Despite forensic , ballistic , and eyewitness evidence supporting the lone gunman theory , public opinion polls taken over the years have shown that most Americans believe that Oswald did not act alone , but conspired with others to kill the president . The assassination has spawned numerous conspiracy theories . \"\n",

It stars Sophia Loren and Anthony Quinn and was directed by George Cukor .   The movie is noted for its lavishly ornate costumes by Edith Head and its impressive photography and use of Technicolor . Though not a commercial success , Heller In Pink Tights is thought by some film historians to be George Cukor 's most lavishly visual film .   Cukor had never been pleased with the `` look '' of most westerns and he hired George Hoyningen-Huene , a famous Russian-born fashion photographer and 1920s illustrator who was an expert at art and design . The final result is a unique film that looks like a cross between a Frederic Remington painting and a Toulouse-Lautrec rendering of music hall performers .   Heller in Pink Tights co-stars Margaret O'Brien , Ramon Novarro and Eileen Heckart . It also marks Loren 's lowest weight on film . The normally voluptuous and full-figured star lost almost twenty pounds at Cukor 's request and donned a blonde wig . \"\n",

It shares borders with Eritrea to the north and northeast , Djibouti and Somalia to the east , Sudan and South Sudan to the west , and Kenya to the south . With over 100 million inhabitants , Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world , as well as the second-most populous nation on the African continent after Nigeria . It occupies a total area of 1,100,000 km2 , and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa .   Some of the oldest evidence for anatomically modern humans has been found in Ethiopia . It is widely considered as the region from which modern humans first set out for the Middle East and places beyond . According to linguists , the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations settled in the Horn region during the ensuing Neolithic era . Tracing its roots to the 2nd millennium BC , Ethiopia was a monarchy for most of its history . During the first centuries AD , the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region , followed by the Ethiopian Empire circa 1137 . Ethiopia derived prestige with its uniquely successful military resistance during the late 19th-century Scramble for Africa , becoming the only African country to defeat a European colonial power and retain its sovereignty . Subsequently , many African nations adopted the colors of Ethiopia 's flag following their independence . It was the first independent African member of the 20th-century League of Nations and the United Nations . In 1974 , at the end of Haile Selassie 's reign , power fell to a communist military dictatorship known as the Derg , backed by the Soviet Union , until it was defeated by the Ethiopian People 's Revolutionary Democratic Front , which has ruled since about the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .   Ethiopia 's ancient Ge'ez script , also known as Ethiopic , is one of the oldest alphabets still in use in the world . The Ethiopian calendar , which is approximately seven years and three months behind the Gregorian calendar , co-exists alongside the Borana calendar . A majority of the population adheres to Christianity -LRB- mainly the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and P'ent ` ay -RRB- , while around a third follows Islam -LRB- primarily Sunni Islam -RRB- . The country is the site of the Migration to Abyssinia and the oldest Muslim settlement in Africa at Negash . A substantial population of Ethiopian Jews , known as Bete Israel , resided in Ethiopia until the 1980s , but most of them have since emigrated to Israel . Ethiopia is a multilingual nation with around 80 ethnolinguistic groups , the four largest of which are the Oromiffa , Amhara , Somali , and Tigrayans . Most people in the country speak Afroasiatic languages of the Cushitic or Semitic branches . Additionally , Omotic languages are spoken by ethnic minority groups inhabiting the southern regions . Nilo-Saharan languages are also spoken by the nation 's Nilotic ethnic minorities .   Ethiopia is the place of origin for the coffee bean which originated from the place called Kefa -LRB- which was one of the 14 provinces in the old Ethiopian administration -RRB- . It is a land of natural contrasts , with its vast fertile West , jungles , and numerous rivers , and the world 's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north . The Ethiopian Highlands are Africa 's largest continuous mountain ranges , and Sof Omar Caves contain Africa 's largest cave . Ethiopia has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Africa .   Ethiopia is one of the founding members of the UN , the Group of 24 -LRB- G-24 -RRB- , the Non-Aligned Movement , G-77 and the Organisation of African Unity . Ethiopia 's capital city Addis Ababa serves as the headquarters of the African Union , the Pan African Chamber of Commerce and Industry , the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa , African Aviation Training HQ , the African Standby Force , and many of the global NGOs focused on Africa . In the 1970s and 1980s , Ethiopia suffered from civil wars and communist purges which devastated its economy . The country has begun to recover recently however , and now has the largest economy -LRB- by GDP -RRB- in East Africa and Central Africa . According to Global Fire Power , Ethiopia has the 42nd most powerful military in the world , and the third most powerful in Africa . \"\n",

It was founded by Chris Blackwell , Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong in Jamaica in 1959 . Blackwell sold the label to PolyGram in 1989 . Both Island and another label recently acquired by PolyGram , A&M Records , were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history , with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive UK music scene in the early 1970s .   Three Island labels exist in the world : Island UK , Island US , and Island Australia , with the main label operating out of London . Notable artists on the UK roster include Ariana Grande , U2 , Mumford & Sons , Amy Winehouse , Ben Howard , Florence + The Machine , John Newman , Hozier , Catfish and the Bottlemen , Disclosure , AlunaGeorge , Keane , James Morrison , Annie Lennox , That Poppy and PJ Harvey .

He graduated from Danish National School of Theatre in Copenhagen in 1993 . Coster-Waldau 's breakthrough performance in Denmark was his role in the film Nightwatch -LRB- 1994 -RRB- . Since then he has appeared in numerous films in his native Scandinavia and Europe in general , including Headhunters -LRB- 2011 -RRB- and A Thousand Times Good Night -LRB- 2013 -RRB- .   In the United States , his debut film role was in the war film Black Hawk Down -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , playing Medal of Honor recipient Gary Gordon . He then played Detective John Amsterdam in the short-lived Fox television series New Amsterdam -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , as well as appearing as Frank Pike in the 2009 Fox television film Virtuality , originally intended as a pilot . He became widely known to a broad audience for his current role as Ser Jaime Lannister , in the HBO series Game of Thrones . In 2017 , he became one of the highest paid actors on television and earned # 2 million per episode of Game of Thrones .  The Fox Broadcasting Company -LRB- often shortened to Fox and stylized as FOX -RRB- is an American English language commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the Fox Entertainment Group subsidiary of 21st Century Fox . The network is headquartered at the 20th Century Fox studio lot on Pico Boulevard in the Century City section of Los Angeles , with additional major offices and production facilities at the Fox Television Center in nearby West Los Angeles and the Fox Broadcasting Center in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan , New York City . It is the third largest major television network in the world based on total revenues , assets , and international coverage .   Launched on October 9 , 1986 as a competitor to the Big Three television networks -LRB- ABC , NBC and CBS -RRB- , Fox went on to become the most successful attempt at a fourth television network . It was the highest-rated broadcast network in the 18 -- 49 demographic from 2004 to 2012 , and earned the position as the most-watched American television network in total viewership during the 2007 -- 08 season .   Fox and its affiliated companies operate many entertainment channels in international markets , although these do not necessarily air the same programming as the U.S. network . Most viewers in Canada have access to at least one U.S.-based Fox affiliate , either over-the-air or through a pay television provider , although Fox 's National Football League telecasts and most of its prime time programming are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for cable and satellite providers imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission -LRB- CRTC -RRB- to protect rights held by domestically based networks .   The network is named after sister company 20th Century Fox , and indirectly for producer William Fox , who founded one of the movie studio 's predecessors , Fox Film .
