His Marxist -- Leninist theories , military strategies , and political policies are collectively known as Maoism or Marxism-Leninism-Maoism .   Born the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan , Hunan , Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook in early life , particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919 . Mao adopted Marxism -- Leninism while working at Peking University and became a founding member of the Communist Party of China -LRB- CPC -RRB- , leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927 . During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang -LRB- KMT -RRB- and the CPC , Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers ' and Peasants ' Red Army , led the Jiangxi Soviet 's radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the Long March . Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War -LRB- 1937 -- 45 -RRB- , after Japan 's defeat China 's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao 's forces defeated the Nationalists who withdrew to Taiwan .   On 1 October 1949 , Mao proclaimed the foundation of the People 's Republic of China -LRB- PRC -RRB- , a one-party state controlled by the CPC . In the following years Mao solidified his control through a campaign of classicide against landlords , and a mass purge of perceived enemies of the state he termed as `` counter-revolutionaries '' alleged to have caused between 2,000,000 to 6,000,000 deaths . -LRB- Mao himself admitting 800,000 deaths in the classicide and 712,000 in the suppression of Counterrevolutionaries -RRB- In 1957 , he launched the Great Leap Forward campaign that aimed to rapidly transform China 's economy from an agrarian economy to an industrial one . The campaign contributed to a widespread famine , whose death toll is estimated at between 15,000,000 and 55,000,000 . In 1966 , he initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution , a program to remove `` counter-revolutionary '' elements of Chinese society that lasted 10 years and which was marked by violent class struggle that killed 400,000 to 10,000,000 people , widespread destruction of cultural artifacts and unprecedented elevation of Mao 's personality cult . In 1972 , Mao welcomed American President Richard Nixon in Beijing , signalling a policy of opening China , which was furthered under the rule of Deng Xiaoping -LRB- 1978 -- 1992 -RRB- . Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 , and died in September , aged 82 . He was succeeded as Paramount leader by Hua Guofeng -LRB- 1976 -- 1978 -RRB- , who was quickly sidelined and replaced by Deng .   A controversial figure , Mao is regarded as one of the most important individuals in modern world history , and is also known as a theorist , military strategist , poet and visionary . Supporters credit him with driving imperialism out of China , modernising China and building it into a world power , promoting the status of women , improving education and health care , and increasing life expectancy as China 's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million under his leadership . In contrast , critics consider him a dictator comparable to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin who damaged traditional Chinese culture , as well as considering him a perpetrator of human rights abuses , and they estimate that Mao was responsible for 40 to 70 million deaths through starvation , prison labour and executions , which would rank his tenure as the top incidence of excess mortality in human history . \"\n",

      " b\"[START] abraham lincoln was a republican candidate for the united states senate in . [END] Abraham Lincoln -LRB- -LSB- \\xcb\\x88e\\xc9\\xaabr\\xc9\\x99h\\xc3\\xa6m_\\xcb\\x88lI\\xc5\\x8bk\\xc9\\x99n -RSB- February 12 , 1809 -- April 15 , 1865 -RRB- was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865 . Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War -- its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis . In doing so , he preserved the Union , paved the way to the abolition of slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the economy .   Born in Hodgenville , Kentucky , Lincoln grew up on the western frontier in Kentucky and Indiana . Largely self-educated , he became a lawyer in Illinois , a Whig Party leader , and was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives , in which he served for eight years . Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 , Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks , tariffs , and railroads . Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress , and because his opposition to the Mexican -- American War was unpopular among Illinois voters , Lincoln returned to Springfield and resumed his successful law practice . Reentering politics in 1854 , he became a leader in building the new Republican Party , which had a statewide majority in Illinois . In 1858 , while taking part in a series of highly publicized debates with his opponent and rival , Democrat Stephen A. Douglas , Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery , but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas .   In 1860 , Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state . Though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the South , he swept the North and was elected president in 1860 . Lincoln 's victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House -- no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession . Subsequently , on April 12 , 1861 , a Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the Union . As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party , Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans , who demanded harsher treatment of the South , War Democrats , who called for more compromise , anti-war Democrats -LRB- called Copperheads -RRB- , who despised him , and irreconcilable secessionists , who plotted his assassination . Politically , Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other , by carefully planned political patronage , and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory . His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy .   Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war . His primary goal was to reunite the nation . He suspended habeas corpus , leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision , and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the Trent Affair in late 1861 . Lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of top generals , including his most successful general , Ulysses S. Grant . He also made major decisions on Union war strategy , including a naval blockade that shut down the South 's normal trade , moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee , and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system . Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond ; each time a general failed , Lincoln substituted another , until finally Grant succeeded . As the war progressed , his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 ; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves , encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery , and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which permanently outlawed slavery .   An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state , Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election . Anticipating the war 's conclusion , Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness . On April 14 , 1865 , five days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee , Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth , a Confederate sympathizer .   Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest U.S. presidents . \"\n",

      " b\"[START] psychology is a relatively new field . [END] Harold D. Roth is Professor of Religious Studies and the Director of the Contemplative Studies Initiative . Roth is a specialist in Methods of Textual Criticism and Textual History , Classical Chinese Religious Thought , Classical Daoism , the Comparative Study of Mysticism and one of the pioneers of the new interdisciplinary academic field of Contemplative Studies .   During an academic career spanning over three decades , Roth has done ground - breaking work in three major intellectual fields . In the first , textual criticism , following the lead of the late SOAS professor Paul Thompson , Roth did the first complete textual history of a major Classical Chinese philosophical work , which he published in his first book , The Textual History of the Huai-nan Tzu . Working towards the goal of establishing modern critical editions of all the major extant works of the classical period , Roth developed a distinctive method he called `` Filiation Analysis , '' a technique for determining the broadest range of possibly authentic textual variants using the bare minimum number of editions . This is detailed in his very first publication , `` Filiation Analysis and the Textual Criticism of the Huai-nan Tzu , '' . It is further developed as a model for all classical Chinese philosophical texts in a later publication , `` Text and Edition in Early Chinese Philosophical Literature '' .   The second major area in which Roth has done pioneering work is in reconstructing the lost history and contemplative dimensions of the late Warring States and early Han dynasty tradition that he dubbed `` inner cultivation . '' It is this tradition that was given the moniker `` Daoism '' by the Grand Historian Sima Tan circa 110 BCE . Beginning with three publications in the early to mid 1990 's , `` Psychology and Self-Cultivation in Early Taoistic Thought , '' `` Who Compiled the Chuang Tzu ? '' , and `` Redaction Criticism and the Early History of Taoism , '' Roth began a detailed textual analysis of classical Chinese texts on inner cultivation demonstrating that they contained a distinctive set of technical terms that could be organized under three philosophical categories : cosmology , psychology/inner cultivation , and political thought . Expanding the work of A.C. Graham , he further determined that these extant sources of inner cultivation could be organized into three distinctive philosophical groupings , `` Individualist , '' Primitivist , and Syncretist and argued these could be considered different phases in the development of this classical Daoist tradition . Roth systematized these arguments in providing the intellectual context for his translation of a short and distinctive text entitled Neiye \\xe5\\x85\\xa7\\xe6\\xa5\\xad -LRB- `` Inward Training '' -RRB- , one of 76 works in the Guanzi \\xe7\\xae\\xa1\\xe5\\xad\\x90compendium , published in his second book , Original Tao : Inward Training and the Foundations of Taoist Mysticism and returned to them in a recent article detailed the contributions to the development of the foundational philosophical idea of li \\xe7\\x90\\x86 -LRB- Pattern , Principle -RRB- made by this classical Daoist tradition in `` The Classical Daoist Concept of Li and Early Chinese Cosmology . ''   In developing these theories about the inner cultivation tradition Roth broke new ground in systematically applying the methods of the philosophical analysis of different traditions of mystical experience to the classical Chinese religious traditions . In addition to being summarized in Original Tao , his work in this area is detailed in a number of important other publications : `` Evidence for Stages of Meditation in Early Taoism , '' `` Lao Tzu in the Context of Early Taoist Mystical Praxis , '' and `` Bimodal Mystical Experience in the ` Qiwulun ' of Zhuangzi '' .   Starting when he entered the Ph.D. program at the University of Toronto in 1975 , Roth began a fascination with the early Han dynasty -LRB- 139 BCE -RRB- philosophical compendium , the Huainanzi \\xe6\\xb7\\xae\\xe5\\x8d\\x97\\xe5\\xad\\x90 , until recently the last great untranslated work of classical Chinese philosophy . Intended as a comprehensive multi-authored text detailing all the fields of knowledge with which the Chinese emperor needed to be conversant , the Huainanzi contains chapters on cosmology and cosmogony , astronomy , geography , rulership , and warfare , to name a few of its major topics . Roth has argued that while the Huainanzi is inclusive of a very wide range philosophical ideas from many traditions , that its overarching intellectual context is provided by the inner cultivation tradition of classical Daoism . After working on the textual history of this major work in his first book , in the mid 1990s Roth developed a project for the first complete English translation with colleague John Major and , eventually , a small cohort of additional scholars that included , most importantly , Sarah Queen and Andrew Meyer . Together they succeeded in finally publishing a complete translation , The Huainanzi : A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Government in Early Han China and an abridged translation , The Essential Huainanzi . In addition to his work on these translations and to his first book , Roth has published his ideas on the philosophy of the Huainanzi in a number of publications , including `` The Concept of Human Nature in the Huai-nan Tzu , '' `` Nature and Self-Cultivation in Huainanzi 's ` Original Way , ' '' `` Daoist Inner Cultivation Thought and the Textual Structure of the Huainanzi , '' and `` Huainanzi \\xe6\\xb7\\xae \\xe5\\x8d\\x97 \\xe5\\xad\\x90and Early Han Daoism . ''   Roth has not only been a leader in developing the new academic field of `` Contemplative Studies , '' he is also the person who first coined the term . Combining the disciplines of the relevant Brain Sciences , Humanities , and Creative Arts around the systematic third and first-person study of contemplative experiences , across cultures and across time , this new field presents bold new pedagogies and research techniques that return the unbiased perspective of the experiencing subject to both classroom and laboratory . Inspired by the work of scientists such as Francisco Varela , James Austin , and Richard Davidson , philosophers such as William James and Evan Thompson , and educators such as John Dewey and Parker Palmer , Brown Contemplative Studies has served as a model for research institutes and academic programs at many institutions of higher education throughout North America . Roth has helped pioneer the field through such publications as `` Contemplative Studies : Prospects for a New Field , '' Columbia Teacher 's College Record -LRB- 2006 -RRB- ; `` Against Cognitive Imperialism , '' Religion East and West -LRB- 2008 -RRB- ; `` Contemplative Studies : Can It Flourish in the Religious Studies Classroom ? '' Meditation and the Classroom : Contemplative Pedagogy for Religious Studies -LRB- 2011 -RRB- ; and `` A Pedagogy for the New Field of Contemplative Studies , '' Contemplative Approaches to Learning and Inquiry across Disciplines -LRB- 2014 -RRB- . In 2014 Brown University became the first major North American Research University to establish a formal undergraduate concentration -LRB- major -RRB- in Contemplative Studies . This pioneering multi-disciplinary concentration requires 14 courses including a core set of 5 required courses in relevant Brain Sciences and Humanities . Students then choose a Sciences track that features Cognitive Psychology and Neuroscience or a Humanities Track that features Philosophy of Mind and Contemplative Religious Traditions . Art concentrations within the Humanities Track are also possible .   Additionally , Roth has served these academic fields in a variety of ways . He served on the Board of Directors of the Society for the Study of Chinese Religions for a decade starting in 1993 , during which time he has also served on the editorial boards of four international journals of Daoism and Early Chinese Studies . In addition to this he was the founder and Co-Organizer of the New England Symposium on Chinese Thought -LRB- 1988 -- 93 -RRB- , the organizer of four academic panels at the Association for Asian Studies and American Oriental Society , and the Co-Organizer of the Second American-Japanese Conference on Taoist Studies -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . He has been a member of the initial Steering Committees for two groups within the American Academy of Religion , the Daoist Studies Section and the Contemplative Studies Group . He has been on the planning committees for the Mind and Life Institute Summer Research Institutes and the first and second International Symposia on Contemplative Studies -LRB- 2012 and 2014 -RRB- .   Finally , a long time student of the Rinzai Zen Master Kyozan Joshu Sasaki -LRB- 1907-2014 -RRB- , Roth was recently named to Chair the Publications Committee for Sasaki 's teaching materials . \"\n",

It is the first installment in The Hunger Games film series and was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik , with a screenplay by Ross , Collins , and Billy Ray . The film stars Jennifer Lawrence , Josh Hutcherson , Liam Hemsworth , Woody Harrelson , Elizabeth Banks , Lenny Kravitz , Stanley Tucci , and Donald Sutherland . The story takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future in the nation of Panem , where boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 must take part in the Hunger Games , a televised annual event in which the `` tributes '' are required to fight to the death until there is only one survivor . Katniss Everdeen -LRB- Lawrence -RRB- volunteers to take her younger sister 's place . Joined by her district 's male tribute , Peeta Mellark -LRB- Hutcherson -RRB- , Katniss travels to the Capitol to train for the Hunger Games under the guidance of former victor Haymitch Abernathy -LRB- Harrelson -RRB- .   Development of The Hunger Games began in March 2009 when Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement with Color Force , which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier . Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay . The screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow . The main characters were cast between March and May 2011 . Principal photography began in May 2011 and ended in September 2011 , with filming taking place in North Carolina . The Hunger Games was shot entirely on film as opposed to digital .   The film was released on March 21 , 2012 , in some European countries and in the US on March 23 , 2012 , in both conventional theaters and digital IMAX theaters . Japan received it last , on September 28 . When the film released , it set records for opening day -LRB- $ 67.3 million -RRB- and opening weekend for a non-sequel . At the time of its release , the film 's opening weekend gross -LRB- $ 152.5 million -RRB- was the third-largest of any movie in North America . It is the first film since Avatar to remain in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends . The film was a massive box-office success by grossing over $ 694 million worldwide against its budget of $ 78 million , making it the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and ninth-highest-grossing worldwide of 2012 . It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 18 , 2012 . With 7,434,058 units sold , the DVD was the best-selling DVD of 2012 . A sequel , The Hunger Games : Catching Fire , was released on November 22 , 2013 , in the United States .   The Hunger Games received positive reviews from critics , with praise for its themes and messages , as well as Jennifer Lawrence 's portrayal of Katniss , though there was criticism of the film 's use of shaky cam in the action sequences . Like the novel , the film has been noted for its similarities to other works , such as Robert Sheckley 's short story `` Seventh Victim '' and its Italian film adaptation The 10th Victim , the Japanese novel Battle Royale and its film adaptation , and the Shirley Jackson short story `` The Lottery '' , with some criticizing The Hunger Games for being derivative of such works . Collins stated in an interview that her novel and screenplay drew on sources of inspiration such as the myth of Theseus , Roman gladiatorial games , reality television , and the desensitization of viewers to media coverage of real-life tragedy and war , not to think as just an audience member , `` Because those are real people on the screen , and they 're not going away when the commercials start to roll .

[END] Albanians -LRB- Shqiptar\\xc3\\xabt -RRB- are an ethnic group , native to Albania , Kosovo and neighboring countries . The term is also used to refer to the citizens of the Republic of Albania . Ethnic Albanians speak the Albanian language and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in Albania and Kosovo . A large Albanian population lives in the Republic of Macedonia and Italy , with smaller Albanian populations located in Serbia and Montenegro . The majority of Albanians are nominally Muslims -LRB- mainly Sunni , with a smaller Shia , Sufi and Bektashi component -RRB- , and a minority are nominally Christians -LRB- Catholic and Orthodox -RRB- .   Albanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg , leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination . During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam , often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects . As Muslims , some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world . Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945 -- 1992 , Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime . Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo . Outside the southwestern Balkans of where Albanians have traditionally been located , Albanian populations through the course of history have formed new communities contributing to the cultural , economic , social and political life of their host populations and countries while also at times assimilating too .   Between the 11th and 18th centuries , sizable numbers of Albanians migrated from the area of contemporary Albania to escape either various socio-political difficulties or the Ottoman conquest . One population which became the Arvanites settled down in southern Greece who starting from the 16th century though mainly during the 19th century onwards assimilated and today self identify as Greeks . Another population , who became the Arb\\xc3\\xabresh\\xc3\\xab settled in southern Italy and form the oldest continuous Albanian diaspora producing influential and many prominent figures . Smaller populations dating to migrations during the 18th century are located on Croatia 's Dalmatian coast and scattered communities across southern Ukraine .   The Albanian diaspora also exists in a number of other countries . One of these is located in Turkey . It was formed during the Ottoman era through economic migration and early years of the Turkish republic through migration for economic reasons and later sociopolitical circumstances of discrimination and violence experienced by Albanians in Balkan countries . Due to the Ottoman legacy , smaller populations of Albanians also exist in Egypt and the Levant , in particular Syria . In Western countries , a large and influential Albanian population exists in the United States formed from continuous emigration dating back to the 19th century . Other Albanians populations due to emigration between the 19th and 21th centuries are located in Australia , Argentina , New Zealand , Canada , Germany , Belgium , United Kingdom , France , Sweden , Switzerland , Slovenia , Croatia , Italy , Finland , Denmark , Norway , Austria , Netherlands , Bulgaria , Greece and Romania . \"\n",

      " b\"[START] patricia franklin was cast in saved . [END] Saved is a play by Edward Bond which premiered at the Royal Court Theatre , London in November 1965 .   The play itself is set in London during the 1960s . Its subject is the cultural poverty and frustration of a generation of young people on the dole and living on council estates . In response to the censorship of the play , Laurence Olivier wrote a letter to The Observer , saying that : `` Saved is not a play for children but it is for grown-ups , and the grown-ups of this country should have the courage to look at it . '' U.S. novelist Mary McCarthy praised its `` remarkable delicacy '' .   Saved was originally refused a licence without severe cuts by the Lord Chamberlain . When it was performed to large private audiences , the Lord Chamberlain decided to prosecute those who were involved in the production of the play . Although the defendants pleaded guilty and were fined , the case reflected badly on the censorship office and was pivotal in the abolition of theatre censorship a few years later in 1968 .   The original cast included John Castle , Tony Selby , Ronald Pickup , Dennis Waterman , William Stewart , Barbara Ferris , Lucy Fleming , Gwen Nelson and Alison Fraser . The creative team included : director William Gaskill and lighting by Eric Baker .   In February 1969 , after the abolition of censorship in the 1968 Theatres Act , Saved was given its first full public run at the Royal Court Theatre in London . The revival cast included : Malcolm Tierney -LRB- as Len -RRB- , Kenneth Cranham -LRB- as Fred -RRB- , Patricia Franklin -LRB- as Pam -RRB- , Queenie Watts -LRB- as Mary -RRB- , Tom Chadbon , Peter Blythe and William Gaskill was the director .   The play is rarely revived , though its theme of social disenfranchisement is seen by Bond as very relevant to the present day . In October 2011 , the play was revived in London for the first time in 27 years , at the Lyric Hammersmith , directed by Sean Holmes . \"\n",

      " b\"[START] alexander hamilton attended a college that is now called harvard university . [END] Alexander Hamilton -LRB- January 11 , 1755 or 1757July 12 , 1804 -RRB- was an American statesman and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States . He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution , as well as the founder of the nation 's financial system , the Federalist Party , the United States Coast Guard , and The New York Post newspaper . As the first Secretary of the Treasury , Hamilton was the main author of the economic policies of the George Washington administration . He took the lead in the funding of the states ' debts by the Federal government , as well as the establishment of a national bank , a system of tariffs , and friendly trade relations with Britain . His vision included a strong central government led by a vigorous executive branch , a strong commercial economy , with a national bank and support for manufacturing , plus a strong military . This was challenged by Virginia agrarians Thomas Jefferson and James Madison who formed a rival party . They favored strong states based in rural America and protected by state militias as opposed to a strong national army and navy . They denounced Hamilton as too friendly toward Britain and toward monarchy in general , and too oriented toward cities , business and banking .   Hamilton was born out of wedlock in Charlestown , Nevis to a married mother of English and French Huguenot ancestry and a Scottish father . His father , James A. Hamilton , was the fourth son of Alexander Hamilton , the laird of Grange , Ayrshire . Orphaned as a child by his mother 's death and his father 's abandonment , Hamilton was taken in by an older cousin and later by a prosperous merchant family . He was recognized for his intelligence and talent , and sponsored by a group of wealthy local men to travel to New York City to pursue his education . Hamilton attended King 's College -LRB- now Columbia University -RRB- , choosing to stay in the Thirteen Colonies to seek his fortune .   Discontinuing his studies before graduating when the college closed its doors during British occupation of the city , Hamilton played a major role in the American Revolutionary War . At the start of the war in 1775 , he joined a militia company . In early 1776 , he raised a provincial artillery company , to which he was appointed captain . He soon became the senior aide to General Washington , the American forces ' commander-in-chief . Hamilton was dispatched by Washington on numerous missions to convey plans to his generals . After the war , Hamilton was elected as a representative to the Congress of the Confederation from New York . He resigned to practice law , and founded the Bank of New York .   Hamilton was among those dissatisfied with the weak national government . He led the Annapolis Convention , which successfully influenced Congress to issue a call for the Philadelphia Convention in order to create a new constitution . He was an active participant at Philadelphia , and he helped achieve ratification by writing 51 of the 85 installments of The Federalist Papers which , to this day , are the single most important reference for Constitutional interpretation .   Hamilton became the leading cabinet member in the new government under President Washington . He was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the national debt , assume states ' debts , and create the government-backed Bank of the United States . These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports , and later also by a highly controversial tax on whiskey . To overcome localism , Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government , especially bankers and businessmen , which became the Federalist Party . A major issue in the emergence of the American two-party system was the Jay Treaty , largely designed by Hamilton in 1794 . It established friendly trade relations with Britain , to the chagrin of France and the supporters of the French Revolution . Hamilton played a central role in the Federalist party , which dominated national and state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson 's Democratic-Republican Party .   In 1795 , he returned to the practice of law in New York . He tried to control the policies of President Adams -LRB- 1797 -- 1801 -RRB- . In 1798 -- 99 , Hamilton called for mobilization against France after the XYZ Affair and became commander of a new army , which he readied for war . However , the Quasi-War was never officially declared and did not involve army action , though it was hard-fought at sea . In the end , President Adams found a diplomatic solution that avoided a war with France . Hamilton 's opposition to Adams ' re-election helped cause his defeat in the 1800 election . Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied for the presidency in the electoral college in 1801 , and Hamilton helped to defeat Burr , whom he found unprincipled , and to elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences .   Hamilton continued his legal and business activities in New York City , and was active in ending the legality of the international slave trade . Vice President Burr ran for governor of New York State in 1804 , and Hamilton crusaded against him as unworthy . Burr took offense and challenged him to a duel . Burr mortally wounded Hamilton , who died the next day . \"\n",

[END] The Fox Broadcasting Company -LRB- often shortened to Fox and stylized as FOX -RRB- is an American English language commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the Fox Entertainment Group subsidiary of 21st Century Fox . The network is headquartered at the 20th Century Fox studio lot on Pico Boulevard in the Century City section of Los Angeles , with additional major offices and production facilities at the Fox Television Center in nearby West Los Angeles and the Fox Broadcasting Center in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan , New York City . It is the third largest major television network in the world based on total revenues , assets , and international coverage .   Launched on October 9 , 1986 as a competitor to the Big Three television networks -LRB- ABC , NBC and CBS -RRB- , Fox went on to become the most successful attempt at a fourth television network . It was the highest-rated broadcast network in the 18 -- 49 demographic from 2004 to 2012 , and earned the position as the most-watched American television network in total viewership during the 2007 -- 08 season .   Fox and its affiliated companies operate many entertainment channels in international markets , although these do not necessarily air the same programming as the U.S. network . Most viewers in Canada have access to at least one U.S.-based Fox affiliate , either over-the-air or through a pay television provider , although Fox 's National Football League telecasts and most of its prime time programming are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for cable and satellite providers imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission -LRB- CRTC -RRB- to protect rights held by domestically based networks .   The network is named after sister company 20th Century Fox , and indirectly for producer William Fox , who founded one of the movie studio 's predecessors , Fox Film . Fox is a member of the North American Broadcasters Association and the National Association of Broadcasters .

He graduated from Danish National School of Theatre in Copenhagen in 1993 . Coster-Waldau 's breakthrough performance in Denmark was his role in the film Nightwatch -LRB- 1994 -RRB- . Since then he has appeared in numerous films in his native Scandinavia and Europe in general , including Headhunters -LRB- 2011 -RRB- and A Thousand Times Good Night -LRB- 2013 -RRB- .   In the United States , his debut film role was in the war film Black Hawk Down -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , playing Medal of Honor recipient Gary Gordon . He then played Detective John Amsterdam in the short-lived Fox television series New Amsterdam -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , as well as appearing as Frank Pike in the 2009 Fox television film Virtuality , originally intended as a pilot . He became widely known to a broad audience for his current role as Ser Jaime Lannister , in the HBO series Game of Thrones . In 2017 , he became one of the highest paid actors on television and earned # 2 million per episode of Game of Thrones . \", shape=(), dtype=string)\n"

Nazi leader Adolf Hitler briefly appointed him a military commander and later Commander of the Replacement -LRB- Home -RRB- Army and General Plenipotentiary for the administration of the entire Third Reich -LRB- Generalbevollm\\xc3\\xa4chtigter f\\xc3\\xbcr die Verwaltung -RRB- . Himmler was one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany and one of the people most directly responsible for the Holocaust .   As a member of a reserve battalion during World War I , Himmler did not see active service . He studied agronomy in college , and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925 . In 1929 , he was appointed Reichsf\\xc3\\xbchrer-SS by Hitler . Over the next 16 years , he developed the SS from a mere 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group , and , following Hitler 's orders , set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps . He was known to have good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates , such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931 . From 1943 onwards , he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior , overseeing all internal and external police and security forces , including the Gestapo -LRB- Secret State Police -RRB- . Himmler had a lifelong interest in occultism , interpreting Germanic neopagan and V\\xc3\\xb6lkisch beliefs to promote the racial policy of Nazi Germany , and incorporating esoteric symbolism and rituals into the SS .   On Hitler 's behalf , Himmler formed the Einsatzgruppen and built extermination camps . As facilitator and overseer of the concentration camps , Himmler directed the killing of some six million Jews , between 200,000 and 500,000 Romani people , and other victims ; the total number of civilians killed by the regime is estimated at eleven to fourteen million people . Most of them were Polish and Soviet citizens .   Late in World War II , Hitler charged Himmler with the command of the Army Group Upper Rhine and the Army Group Vistula ; he failed to achieve his assigned objectives and Hitler replaced him in these posts . Realising that the war was lost , he attempted to open peace talks with the western Allies without Hitler 's knowledge shortly before the war ended . Hearing of this , Hitler dismissed him from all his posts in April 1945 and ordered his arrest . Himmler attempted to go into hiding , but was detained and then arrested by British forces once his identity became known . While in British custody , he committed suicide on 23 May 1945 . \"\n",

He was the country 's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election . His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation . Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist , he served as President of the African National Congress -LRB- ANC -RRB- party from 1991 to 1997 .   A Xhosa , Mandela was born in Mvezo to the Thembu royal family . He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg . There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics , joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944 . After the National Party 's white-only government established apartheid -- a system of racial segregation that privileged whites -- he and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow . Mandela was appointed President of the ANC 's Transvaal branch , rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People . He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial . Influenced by Marxism , he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party -LRB- SACP -RRB- . Although initially committed to non-violent protest , in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government . In 1962 , he was arrested for conspiring to overthrow the state and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial .   Mandela served 27 years in prison , initially on Robben Island , and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison . Amid growing domestic and international pressure , and with fears of a racial civil war , President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990 . Mandela and de Klerk negotiated an end to apartheid and organised the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became President . Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution , Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country 's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses . Economically , Mandela 's administration retained its predecessor 's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs , also introducing measures to encourage land reform , combat poverty , and expand healthcare services . Internationally , he acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999 . He declined a second presidential term and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy , Thabo Mbeki . Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation .   Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life . Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the radical left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid 's supporters , he gained international acclaim for his activism . Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice , he received more than 250 honours -- including the Nobel Peace Prize -- and became the subject of a cult of personality . He is held in deep respect within South Africa , where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name , Madiba , and described as the `` Father of the Nation '' . \"\n",

Simone employed a broad range of musical styles including classical , jazz , blues , folk , R&B , gospel , and pop .   Born in North Carolina , the sixth child of a preacher , Waymon aspired to be a concert pianist . With the help of a few supporters in her hometown of Tryon , North Carolina , she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York .   Waymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia , where she was denied despite a well-received audition . Waymon became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to her race , a statement that has been a matter of controversy . Years later , two days before her death , the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed on her an honorary degree .   To make a living , Eunice Waymon changed her name to `` Nina Simone '' . The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members , having chosen to play `` the devil 's music '' or `` cocktail piano '' at a nightclub in Atlantic City . She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment , and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist .   Simone recorded more than 40 albums , mostly between 1958 , when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue , and 1974 . She had a hit in the United States in 1958 with `` I Loves You , Porgy '' .   Simone 's musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music , in particular Johann Sebastian Bach , and accompanied expressive , jazz-like singing in her contralto voice . \"\n",

The Seljuk Sultanate of R\\xc3\\xbbm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243 , when it disintegrated into small Turkish beyliks .   In the mid-14th century the Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeast Europe , West Asia and North Africa , becoming a major power in Eurasia and Africa during the early modern period . The empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century , especially during the reign -LRB- 1520 -- 1566 -RRB- of Suleiman the Magnificent . It remained powerful and influential for two more centuries , until important setbacks in the 17th and 18th century forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe , signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth . After the 1913 Ottoman coup d'\\xc3\\xa9tat which effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas the Ottoman Empire decided to join the Central Powers during World War I which were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers . During the war , the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian , Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens .   Following the war , the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was partitioned into several new states . The Turkish War of Independence -LRB- 1919 -- 1922 -RRB- , initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atat\\xc3\\xbcrk and his colleagues against the occupying Allies , resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 , with Atat\\xc3\\xbcrk as its first president . Atat\\xc3\\xbcrk enacted numerous reforms , many of which incorporated various aspects of Western thought , philosophy , and customs into the new form of Turkish government .   Turkey is a charter member of the UN , an early member of NATO , and a founding member of the OECD , OSCE , OIC and G-20 . After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949 , Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963 , joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005 . Turkey 's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power while its location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history .   Turkey 's current administration headed by president Tayyip Erdo\\xc4\\x9fan has reversed many of the country 's earlier reforms which had been in place since the founding of the modern republic of Turkey , such as Freedom of the Press , a Legislative System of Checks and Balances , and a set of standards for secularism in government , as first enacted by Atat\\xc3\\xbcrk . \"\n",

It is the world 's largest religion , with over 2.4 billion followers , or 33 % of the global population , known as Christians . Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah -LRB- the Christ -RRB- was prophesied in the Old Testament .   Christian theology is summarized in creeds such as the Apostles ' Creed and Nicene Creed . These professions of faith state that Jesus suffered , died , was buried , descended into hell , and rose from the dead , in order to grant eternal life to those who believe in him and trust in him for the remission of their sins . The creeds further maintain that Jesus bodily ascended into heaven , where he reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit , and that he will return to judge the living and the dead and grant eternal life to his followers . His incarnation , earthly ministry , crucifixion and resurrection are often referred to as `` the gospel '' , meaning `` good news '' . `` Good news '' is a translation of the Ancient Greek term \\xce\\xb5\\xe1\\xbd\\x90\\xce\\xb1\\xce\\xb3\\xce\\xb3\\xce\\xad\\xce\\xbb\\xce\\xb9\\xce\\xbf\\xce\\xbd euang\\xc3\\xa9lion , from which the terms evangelical and evangelism derive . The term gospel also refers to written accounts of Jesus 's life and teaching , four of which -- Matthew , Mark , Luke and John -- are considered canonical and included in the Christian Bible .   Christianity is an Abrahamic religion that began as a Second Temple Judaic sect in the mid-1st century . Originating in Judea , it quickly spread to Europe , Syria , Mesopotamia , Asia Minor , Transcaucasia , Egypt , Ethiopia and India , and by the end of the 4th century had become the official state church of the Roman Empire . Following the Age of Discovery , Christianity spread to the Americas , Australasia , sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization . Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization .   Throughout its history , Christianity has weathered schisms and theological disputes that have resulted in many distinct churches and denominations . Worldwide , the three largest branches of Christianity are the Catholic Church , the Eastern Orthodox Church and the various denominations of Protestantism . The Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches broke communion with each other in the East -- West Schism of 1054 ; Protestantism came into existence in the Reformation of the 16th century , splitting from the Catholic Church . \"\n",

The reference to South America instead of other regions -LRB- like Latin America or the Southern Cone -RRB- has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics -LRB- in particular , the rise of Brazil -RRB- .   It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean ; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest . It includes twelve sovereign states -LRB- Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Paraguay , Peru , Suriname , Uruguay , and Venezuela -RRB- , a part of France -LRB- French Guiana -RRB- , and a non-sovereign area -LRB- the Falkland Islands , a British Overseas Territory though this is disputed by Argentina -RRB- . In addition to this , the ABC islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands , Trinidad and Tobago , and Panama may also be considered part of South America .   South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers -LRB- 6,890,000 sq mi -RRB- . Its population has been estimated at more than 371,090,000 . South America ranks fourth in area -LRB- after Asia , Africa , and North America -RRB- and fifth in population -LRB- after Asia , Africa , Europe , and North America -RRB- . Brazil is by far the most populous South American country , with more than half of the continent 's population , followed by Colombia , Argentina , Venezuela and Peru . In recent decades Brazil has also concentrated half of the region 's GDP and has become a first regional power .   Most of the population lives near the continent 's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the far south are sparsely populated . The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes mountains ; in contrast , the eastern part contains both highland regions and large lowlands where rivers such as the Amazon , Orinoco , and Paran\\xc3\\xa1 flow . Most of the continent lies in the tropics .   The continent 's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of indigenous peoples with European conquerors and immigrants and , more locally , with African slaves .

Respublika Kazakhstan -RRB- , is a transcontinental country in northern Central Asia and Eastern Europe . Kazakhstan is the world 's largest landlocked country , and the ninth largest in the world , with an area of 2,724,900 km \\xc2\\xb2 . Kazakhstan is the dominant nation of Central Asia economically , generating 60 % of the region 's GDP , primarily through its oil/gas industry . It also has vast mineral resources .   Kazakhstan is officially a democratic , secular , unitary , constitutional republic with a diverse cultural heritage . Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia , China , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan , and Turkmenistan , and also adjoins a large part of the Caspian Sea . The terrain of Kazakhstan includes flatlands , steppe , taiga , rock canyons , hills , deltas , snow-capped mountains , and deserts . Kazakhstan has an estimated 18 million people , Given its large land area , its population density is among the lowest , at less than 6 people per square kilometre -LRB- 15 people per sq. mi . -RRB- . The capital is Astana , where it was moved in 1997 from Almaty , the country 's largest city .   The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by nomadic tribes . This changed in the 13th century , when Genghis Khan occupied the country as part of the Mongolian Empire . Following internal struggles among the conquerors , power eventually reverted to the nomads . By the 16th century , the Kazakh emerged as a distinct group , divided into three j\\xc3\\xbcz -LRB- ancestor branches occupying specific territories -RRB- . The Russians began advancing into the Kazakh steppe in the 18th century , and by the mid-19th century , they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the Russian Empire . Following the 1917 Russian Revolution , and subsequent civil war , the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganised several times . In 1936 , it was made the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic , part of the Soviet Union .   Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence during the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The current President , Nursultan Nazarbayev , has been leader of the country since then , and is characterised as authoritarian , with a government history of human rights abuses and suppression of political opposition . Kazakhstan has worked to develop its economy , especially its dominant hydrocarbon industry . Human Rights Watch says that `` Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly , speech , and religion , '' and other human rights organisations regularly describe Kazakhstan 's human rights situation as poor .   Kazakhstan 's 131 ethnicities include Kazakhs -LRB- 63 % of the population -RRB- , Russians , Uzbeks , Ukrainians , Germans , Tatars , and Uyghurs . Islam is the religion of about 70 % of the population , with Christianity practised by 26 % ; Kazakhstan officially allows freedom of religion , but religious leaders who oppose the government are suppressed . The Kazakh language is the state language , and Russian has equal official status for all levels of administrative and institutional purposes . \"\n",
      " b\"[START] england became the first industrialized nation . [END] England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom . It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west . The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest . England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south . The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain -LRB- which lies in the North Atlantic -RRB- in its centre and south ; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly , and the Isle of Wight .   The area now called England was first inhabited by modern humans during the Upper Palaeolithic period , but takes its name from the Angles , one of the Germanic tribes who settled during the 5th and 6th centuries . England became a unified state in the 10th century , and since the Age of Discovery , which began during the 15th century , has had a significant cultural and legal impact on the wider world . The English language , the Anglican Church , and English law -- the basis for the common law legal systems of many other countries around the world -- developed in England , and the country 's parliamentary system of government has been widely adopted by other nations . The Industrial Revolution began in 18th-century England , transforming its society into the world 's first industrialised nation .   England 's terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains , especially in central and southern England . However , there are uplands in the north -LRB- for example , the mountainous Lake District , and the Pennines -RRB- and in the southwest -LRB- for example , Dartmoor and the Cotswolds -RRB- . The capital is London , which is the largest metropolitan area in both the United Kingdom and the European Union.According to the European Statistical Agency , London is the largest Larger Urban Zone in the EU , a measure of metropolitan area which comprises a city 's urban core as well as its surrounding commuting zone . London 's municipal population is also the largest in the EU . England 's population of over 53 million comprises 84 % of the population of the United Kingdom , largely concentrated around London , the South East , and conurbations in the Midlands , the North West , the North East , and Yorkshire , which each developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century .   The Kingdom of England -- which after 1535 included Wales -- ceased being a separate sovereign state on 1 May 1707 , when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year , resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain . In 1801 , Great Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . In 1922 the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom , leading to the latter being renamed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . \"], shape=(32,), dtype=string)\n"
